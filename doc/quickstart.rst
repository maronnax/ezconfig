Quickstart
--------------

This file describes how one goes about installing and using ezconfig
to solve a variety of common tasks such as searching for configuration
files, looking through multiple configuration files for values, and
parsing configuration values.

If you've spent too much of your life writing too many little parsers
to read configuration strings, this library may help you save
what little time you have left on this planet for more productive
activities.
